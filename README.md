# Modulation of microglia activation after human donor retinal ganglion cell
transplantation

Baramov lab project on studying microglia activation. <br />
Stem cell-derived retinal ganglion cell (RGC) transplantation therapy offers a promising avenue for restoring vision in patients with significant RGC loss. The major challenge in this therapeutic approach is ensuring the survival of transplanted human donor RGCs within the host retina. Here, we demonstrated the pivotal role of host retinal microglia and macrophages in the acceptance and survival of human donor cells. In addition, in the current study, we showed that it is possible to improve interaction between RGCs and microglia and the survival of human donor stem-cell-derived RGCs through modulation of the host retinal microglia. Pretreatment of human donor RGCs with annexin V and soluble FasL (sFasL) before transplantation significantly enhanced their acceptance and survival rate.   Detailed  analyses   of   the   host   mouse   retina   post-transplantation revealed morphological changes and activation patterns in microglia and macrophages. These findings indicate that sFasL and annexin V treatment can be used to improve the success rate of transplantation of neurons within the retina.
